### N(NYADDEC is)
### Y(Yet)
### A(Another)
### DD(Dungeons & Dragons)
### EC(Encounter Creator)

I wanted to make a d&d encounter builder for a really long time, but now I have aquired alot of knowledge about how to build a web application.  So now I want to build a web application that is asynchronus with rust. I am following the steps in [pretzelhammer's guide](https://github.com/pretzelhammer/rust-blog/blob/master/posts/restful-api-in-sync-and-async-rust.md#sql-schema-migrations-wdiesel-cli); however, I am using my own spin on the concept to meet my own criteria of an enterprise application should look like.  PretzelHammer has made such a good guide on asynchronus and synchronus web applications so I think you should really check out that web page.

For me I wanted to make an async rust api so that I could eventually push this to the web. The Frontend will all be written in react, [nyaddec-frontend](https://github.com/adamkali/nyaddec-frontend). Then when I am getting nyaddec's backend up and running, I will be taking the next step and implememnting Next.js. I really want to make this a snappy website where people can go and make a good Encounter for Dungeons & Dragons.

## Plans for the Future

In the end I will be trying to implement battles and homebrew, so be sure to follow for that. That being said, I still for see that being a long way away from implementation. Once The backend is implemented completely, and I am satisfied with the how the backend works; then I will begin implementing the homebrew aspect. So the plan is as follows:

1. Finish the backend,
2. Implement Next.js
3. Deployment on aws.
4. Create a Monster Homebrew service.
5. Create a Battle Service.
6. Implemnt Leveling.js
7. Create more a more in depth Party service.
